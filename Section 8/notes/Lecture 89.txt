Best way to test action creators getting called is using an unconnected component

We pass a mock function

What is a Mock Fucntion?
- Fake function that runs instead of a real function
    - Can run alternate code or act as a placeholder

- Jest replaces real function with mock function

- Can assert on how many times it was called during the test
    - Can be called with arguements
